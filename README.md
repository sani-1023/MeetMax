## üì° Backend/API Simulation

**Assumption:**  
This project does **not** connect to a real backend. All API calls (such as login, signup, post, like, and comment) are simulated using `setTimeout` and mock data within React components.

- No authentication or data is persisted.
- You can replace the mock logic with real API calls as needed.

---

## üìÑ Assumptions

- All icons are SVGs imported as image sources.
- The navigation bar is fixed at the bottom for mobile-first design.
- The backend/API is simulated for demo purposes.
